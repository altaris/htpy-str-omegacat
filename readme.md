This document is unofficial notes taken from the lectures "Homotopy Theory of Strict ω-Categories" given by [François Métayer](https://www.irif.fr/~metayer/index.html) during the conference ["Categories in Homotopy Theory and Rewriting"](http://conferences.cirm-math.fr/1773.html), held at CIRM in September 2017. It can contain many typos and mistakes, and some notations have been changed from the original lecture.
